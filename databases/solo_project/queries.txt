Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
sqlite> select * from children

Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
sqlite> update children set name="Prince George" WHERE name="George";
sqlite> select * from children
   ...> ;
1|Prince George|1984|1
2|Charlotte|2008|1
3|Savannah|1969|2

Display the information in both tables using one query.
sqlite> select * from children, fathers where children.father_id = fathers.id;
1|Prince George|1984|1|1|William
2|Charlotte|2008|1|1|William
3|Savannah|1969|2|2|Peter


Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
sqlite> select children.name, fathers.name from children, fathers where children.father_id = fathers.id;
Prince George|William
Charlotte|William
Savannah|Peter

Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
sqlite> select * from children
   ...> ;
1|Prince George|1984|1
2|Charlotte|2008|1
3|Savannah|1969|2
sqlite> delete from children where name = "Charlotte";
sqlite> select * from children;
1|Prince George|1984|1
