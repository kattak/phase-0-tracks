I've worked with JQuery before, but I have no idea what I used to do.

My plan is to review some of the old projects I worked on, and then research whatever I don't remember.
Then, I want to add at least one new thing using JQuery to an existing project.

Time:
15 minutes - Yoshi project, pure Javascipt, no JQuery
30 minutes - Simple Word Blox
10 minutes - Simple Word Blox 2
10 minutes - break
30 minutes - MCAT Blox
20 minutes - add something new to MCAT Blox
5 minutes - Review & Reflect
